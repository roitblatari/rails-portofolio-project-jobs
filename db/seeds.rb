# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



 #
 # Employer.create(name: "unedefind", password: "undefind", uid: "unedefind", email: "unedefind"  )
 # Employee.create(name: "unedefind", password: "undefind", uid: "unedefind", email: "unedefind"  )
 # Job.create(title: "unedefind", title:  "unedefind", address: "unedefind", state:  "unedefind", date: "unedefind")
